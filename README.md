This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to predict flight ticket prices, aiding travelers in making informed decisions. By analyzing historical flight data including departure/arrival locations, dates, times, airlines, and other factors, the system learns patterns in pricing dynamics. Key objectives include data collection and preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection and training, model evaluation and optimization, and deployment with a user-friendly interface. Successful implementation will provide travelers with accurate price predictions, improving trip planning efficiency, while also benefiting stakeholders in the aviation industry through better pricing strategies and demand forecasting.
     
# introduction

In this article, we will be analyzing flight fare prediction using a machine learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.


# conclusion and future scope 

For this paper, an extensive study was carried out with dataset collection from Kaggle and Random Forest Machine Learning model was used for deployment. Using visualization, we were able to determine the features which influence airfare prices the most. With experimental analysis, it can be concluded that Random Forest Regression model achieves good accuracy. The future aim is to work more on the feature selection and model accuracy. We also plan to extend the study by working with larger datasets and greater number of experimentations on the same to procure more accurate airfares which will in turn help users to get an estimated cost of their next airplane travel and can benefit them to make the best deal. We also plan to level up web applications' user interface to provide a premium user experience. We can also consider various other crucial features that affect airplane ticket prices like public holidays, number of luggage, number of hours till departure, crude oil price, etc. in order to get best results. In the near future, there is also a plan to host the web application.
